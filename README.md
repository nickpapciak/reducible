## what is `reducible`‚ùì
Reducible compresses the parameters of a neural network using a lossy compression technique called rank-k approximation. 


## our inspiration ü§©
Our idea came from when the team was thinking about how awesome JPEG is. It is able to take your images, throw out a ton of the data, and yet reconstruct the image in a way that makes it seem nearly identical to the human eye. For this hackathon, we thought about how we could use this idea to compress not just images, but compress neural networks.
